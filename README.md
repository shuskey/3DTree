# 3DTree
This is the Unity Project that turns your Family Tree into a 3D Platformer gaming experience

Prerequisites:
Requires the "Complete Physics Platformer Kit" from Icarus Studio.  Available on the Unity Asset Store.
I have begun to use "ProBuilder Basic" from ProCore.  Available on the Unity Asset Store.
Requires 3DFamilyTreeFileUtilty (github.com/shuskey/3DFamilyTreeFileUtility) in order to read your family tree from FamilySearch.org and
save it as an XML file that 3DTree reads in.  This File Utility will now also simulate family history data now.  I call this the "Adam and Eve, be fruitful and multiply" functionality.
